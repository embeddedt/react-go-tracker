# React GO tracker

This is a small hobby project of mine which allows tracking GO Transit train locations in realtime. In the future, it may
expand to other GTA transit services as well.

## Disclaimer

While the code in this project is licensed under AGPLv3, at runtime, the train data is sourced directly from the same
infrastructure which powers the official [GO Transit tracker](http://gotracker.ca/gotracker/web/). Please be aware of their
tool's terms of use before using this tracker.
